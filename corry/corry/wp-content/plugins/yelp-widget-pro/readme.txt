2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it! You should now be able to access the Plugin's options via your settings panel.  You will need to enter your Yelp API information prior to using the plugin.

Note: If you have Wordpress 2.7 or above you can simply go to 'Plugins' &gt; 'Add New' in the WordPress admin and search for "Yelp Widget Pro" and install it from there.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use this plugin? =

Use this plugin if you have a website that would benefit in displaying search results for a Yelp search term.  For example, a travel website selling reservations could display the top resorts for a given destination.  A business website could also display their yelp business listing in their sidebar by using the Business ID search option

= How do I display only my business? =

If you would like to display only your certain business then you must enter in your "Yelp Business ID" in the widget's ID input.  The ID of the business is the last part of the Yelp URL of its Yelp page. Ex: `http://www.yelp.com/biz/togos-sandwiches-san-diego-3`, the id is `togos-sandwiches-san-diego-3`.  This is the *only* parameter you need to set to use this method.

= How do I disable the CSS =

If you would like to theme the widget yourself you should disable the plugin's CSS output.  To do that please visit the options page (Settings > Yelp Widget Pro) and check the appropriate option.

= The plugin looks funny in my sidebar, what's the deal? =

Some themes may have very small sidebars and CSS styles that conflict or alter the styles within Yelp Widget Pro.  To correct any styling errors you can either disable the plugin's CSS all together or override the CSS selectors in use to make the widget appear how you'd like.  CSS-related issues are not actively supported as there's too many variations between the thousands of WordPress themes available.

== Screenshots ==

1. A view of the Yelp Widget Pro Settings page displaying the metabox to enter in your Yelp API v2.0 Information

2. Many plugins don't have the option to disable CSS - this one does.  If you want to style the plugin to suit your needs then enable this option.

3. Yelp Widget Pro expanded displaying all available options as of version 1.1

4. How the widget looks in a website sidebar
